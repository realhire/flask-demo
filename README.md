# flask-stock-demo
Basic template for using Flask on Heroku

requirements:
Flask (Python Web Framework)
numpy (a Python libraray for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices)
pandas (a data analysis library)
bokeh (a Python interactive visualization library)

Please read app.py, template/end_lulu.html and template/index.html.
The whole project is a sample demo learned from the other projects.

I also have a demo website for this project: https://flask-stock-demo.herokuapp.com.
Please try it, although there are some problems which I fixed in the github, but not in the website.

Let me know your questions about this.
